                <p>Hello, my name is Letlotlo Hlaoli, a pharmacist with a fervent interest in integrating computer science into the realm of healthcare. Originally from Lesotho, I embarked on a journey in pharmaceutical science, earning a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from the National University of Lesotho. My career path led me through various roles, including pharmacist at Letseng Diamonds Naleli Medi-Clinic and management consultant at Grace Pharmacy Pty Ltd. In these capacities, I developed expertise in inventory management, budgeting, and strategic planning, always striving for operational excellence. However, my passion for innovation and my recognition of technology's potential to transform healthcare prompted me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at Brigham Young University-Idaho. My aim is to integrate advanced computer skills such as programming, data analysis, and artificial intelligence with my healthcare background to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Through this interdisciplinary approach, I aspire to optimize supply chain management, streamline medication processes, and enhance patient care outcomes. As I continue my studies, I am eager to delve deeper into the intersection of healthcare and technology, exploring opportunities to leverage cutting-edge tools and techniques for the betterment of patient well-being. My ultimate goal is to become a leader in the field of health informatics, driving innovation and transformation that positively impacts healthcare systems worldwide.</p>
